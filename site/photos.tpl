            <p style="text-align: justify" class="smalltext">Here are some pieces of fine art I stumbled upon on the Internet by complete coincidence. Here, you see the depiction of the artist who created the beauties below. His supreme understanding of the subject of graphical design has allowed the humanity to interiorize the gorgeous sight of the sunset in different contexts. It is believed that the meaning of life is encoded somewhere in these demonstrations of virtuosity, but nobody was able to find it. The reason I put these here was to help people who want to know me more, by letting them know what kind of art I enjoy.</p>
